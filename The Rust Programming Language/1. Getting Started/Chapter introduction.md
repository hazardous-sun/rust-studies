# Getting Started

Let’s start your Rust journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

* Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  * `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
* Writing a program that prints Hello, world!
* Using cargo, Rust’s package manager and build system
